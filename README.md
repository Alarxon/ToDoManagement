# ToDoManagement
A simple CRUD To Do List Management System, made with PHP, MySQL and a MVC approach

![Home Screenshot](ToDoHome.png)

## Requirements
- PHP 8
- MySQL (I used version MariaDB 10.4.22, but any modern version should work)
- Apache Web Server (I used version 2.4, but any modern version should work)

**NOTE: I used a Windows environment for the build and testing of this project, particularly XAMPP was used as a Web Server solution stack.**
